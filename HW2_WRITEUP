CS270 HW 2 submission

Run:
./hw2.sh [absDir] halt test1 test2 test3 test4 test5 
_NOTE_ test2 will ask for 2 chars to be entered from console
_NOTE_ test4 will ask for 5 chars to be entered from console
_NOTE_ test5 will fail due to not enough memory.
(requires that test scripts are executed from userprog as in hw2.sh)



Tasks :
Fork() - Completed no issues. Create new thread, copy addrSpace, and move PC to argument1.
Yield() - Completed no issues. Called thread->yield().
Exit() - Completed no issues. Set the exit code via procMgr, clean up pages in procMgr, and wrote result to registers. Broadcasts to condition.
Exec() - Completed no issues. Initialize addrSpace, copy file into memory, forks to a bridge function with the new PC (0).
Join() - Completed no issues. Use condition to block on a given PID.
Create() - Completed no issues. Get filename and call filesystem create
Open() - Completed no issues.  Opens a file and registers file as a singleton openSysFile (on a fixed array with a index as FD) and PCB userOpenFile. Return FD
Read() - Completed no issues. Copies from file into diskBuffer into memory. Translation occurs. Checks for user console input of given size.
Write() - Completed no issues. Inverse of Read.
Close() - Completed no issues. Remove from openSysFile and PCB userOpenFile. Clean.
Added the required outputs that will show when call with -d 2  (DEBUG level '2').
